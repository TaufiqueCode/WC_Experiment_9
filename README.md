# Experiment 9 – [Your Experiment Title Here]

## 🎯 Aim
To [state the aim of Experiment 9 here, e.g., "design and simulate inter-VLAN routing" or "configure static routing in Cisco Packet Tracer"].

## 🛠 Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- One switch
- One router
- PCs as end devices

## 📖 Theory
In this experiment, we extend our understanding of computer networks by configuring [insert the main concept of Experiment 9, e.g., inter-VLAN routing, static routing, or dynamic routing].  
This setup allows devices in different networks or VLANs to communicate with each other through a router, demonstrating how logical segmentation and routing work together.

## ⚙️ Procedure
1. Create the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Configure the router and switch with the required settings.  
3. Assign IP addresses to all PCs.  
4. Verify connectivity within the same network.  
5. Test communication across different networks using the router.  

## 📂 Files
- `Experiment 9.pkt` → Packet Tracer topology file

## ✅ Output
- Successful ping tests between devices in the same network.  
- Successful communication between devices in different networks after routing configuration.  
- Screenshots of topology, CLI commands, and ping results can be added here.

## 📝 Conclusion
We successfully implemented [insert concept, e.g., inter-VLAN routing/static routing] in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
This experiment demonstrated how routers enable communication between different networks or VLANs.
